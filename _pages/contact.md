<h2>Join National DSA!</h2>

The [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/) is the largest socialist organization in the United States because weâ€™re a member-driven mass organization. We are a political and activist organization, not a party. We believe that working people should run both the economy and civil society, and we show our commitment to this principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class.

[Join DSA](https://www.dsausa.org/join) today!

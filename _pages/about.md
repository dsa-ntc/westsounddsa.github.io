We are the West Sound chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Throughout Kitsap County, our chapter fights for the good of the many, not the few. <br>
<br>
  **We advocate for tenants rights with our partner organization, [Kitsap Housing For All](https://www.kitsaphousing4all.org/)<br>
  We have a zine called "The West Sound Socialist" that promotes local journalism and art while destigmatizing socialist ideas.<br>
  We reach out to local representatives to advocate for the working class. <br>
  We have a reading group every other Monday. <br>

**National DSA Article II. Purpose**
We are socialists because we reject an economic order based on private profit, alienated labor, gross inequalities of wealth and power, discrimination based on race, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, age, religion, and national origin, and brutality and violence in defense of the status quo. We are socialists because we share a vision of a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning, equitable distribution, feminism, racial equality, and non-oppressive relationships. We are socialists because we are developing a concrete strategy for achieving that vision, for building a majority movement that will make democratic socialism a reality in America. We believe that such a strategy must acknowledge the class structure of American society and that this class structure means that there is a basic conflict of interest between those sectors with enormous economic power and the vast majority of the population.

<h2>Join DSA!</h2>

The [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/) is the largest socialist organization in the United States because weâ€™re a member-driven mass organization. We are a political and activist organization, not a party. We believe that working people should run both the economy and civil society, and we show our commitment to this principle by being an organization of, by, and for the working class.
